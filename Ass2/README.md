# Word Embedding, FeedForward Neural Network and RNNs

### Main Goal

* Compute word embeddings in a toy example.
* Play around with feedforward neural networks in PyTorch and use them to solve the sentiment classification problem from Project 1.
* Implement an RNN model for character-level classification.
