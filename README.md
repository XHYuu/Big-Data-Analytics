### Project: Natural Language Processing and Text Analysis

#### project1: Sentiment Classification on Movie Reviews
*Goal:*  
* *Implement basic feature extraction and classification algorithms for text classification*

* [Jump to first project](Ass1/README.md)
* [The task instruction book](Ass1/Project1_task_instruction.pdf)

#### project2: Word Embedding, FeedForward Neural Network and RNNs
*Goal:*
* *Compute word embeddings in a toy example.*  
* *Play around with feedforward neural networks in PyTorch and use them to solve the sentiment classification problem from Project 1.*
* *Implement an RNN model for character-level classification.*
