### Project: Natural Language Processing and Text Analysis

#### project1: Sentiment Classification on Movie Reviews
*Goal:*  
* *Implement basic feature extraction and classification algorithms for text classification*

* [Jump to first project](Ass1/README.md)
* [The task instruction book](Ass1/Project1_task_instruction.pdf)

#### project2: Word Embedding, FeedForward Neural Network and RNNs
*Goal:*
* *Compute word embeddings in a toy example.*  
* *Play around with feedforward neural networks in PyTorch and use them to solve the sentiment classification problem from Project 1.*
* *Implement an RNN model for character-level classification.*

#### project3: Transformer Mechanics, Application, and Pre-training/Fine-tuning Analysis
*Goal:*

* *Implement key architectural components to grasp their fundamental mechanics.*  
* *Gain practical experience by fine-tuning a pre-trained model for text classification.*
* *Analyze concepts related to model architecture, pre-training, and fine-tuning techniques.*
